\begin{abstract}
Inspired by the success of machine learning in other domains and to prevent the getting more and more sophisticated of malicious applications, various machine learning-based malware detectors have been proposed, since at least 1995 \cite{kephart1995biologically}.

In this study, we research the two essential approaches for malware detection (i.e., static and dynamic analysis) and conduct experiments to apply the machine learning methods in static malware detection. We also apply a static malware detection method using Gradient Boosting Decision Tree algorithm. The model performs a 97.572\% detection rate at 0.1\% false alarm rate, based on more than 600,000 training and 200,000 testing samples from Endgame Malware BEnchmark for Research (EMBER) dataset \cite{anderson2018ember}.

In comparison with the dataset publisher's baseline method, although we use a feature space with fewer dimensions (1711 instead of 2351, which is proposed by EMBER dataset owners) to reduce the training time, we manage to achieve a better performance.
