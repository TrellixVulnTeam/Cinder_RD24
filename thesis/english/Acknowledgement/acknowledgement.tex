\begin{acknowledgements}      

First and foremost, I would like to express my most sincere acknowledgments to my instructor, Assoc Prof. Dr.  Vu Thanh Nguyen. I are utterly grateful and indebted to him for his invaluable instructions, valuable guidance, and continuous moral encouragement. Thanks to his extraordinary experience in computer science and teaching, I acquired new, exciting, and valuable knowledge in the fields of malware detection and machine learning. Furthermore, he is the source of inspiration that leads me through the obstacles during the time working on my thesis. Without his help, I would not have been able to complete this thesis.

I would also thank MS. Huynh Nguyen Khac Huy for his guidance in machine learning and computer security.

I are also grateful to all of my lecturers in the faculty of Software Engineering in the University of Information Technology. Thanks to their dedication to me, I have a strong foundation in computer science and acquire knowledge of the current state of the technology market. Owing to them, I are capable of learning and applying new technologies more effectively.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my families for offering their encouragement and financial aids when I need them. I are forever grateful for their unconditional love.
