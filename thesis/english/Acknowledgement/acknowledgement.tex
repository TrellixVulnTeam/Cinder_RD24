First and foremost, we would like to express our most sincere acknowledgments to our instructor, Assoc Prof. Dr.  Vu Thanh Nguyen. We are utterly grateful and indebted to him for his invaluable instructions, valuable guidance, and continuous moral encouragement. Thanks to his extraordinary experience in computer science and teaching, we acquired new, exciting, and valuable knowledge in the fields of malware detection and machine learning. Furthermore, he is the source of inspiration that leads us through the obstacles during the time working on our thesis. Without his help, we would not have been able to complete this thesis.

We would also thank MS. Huynh Nguyen Khac Huy for his guidance in machine learning and computer security.

We are also grateful to all of our lecturers in the faculty of Software Engineering in the University of Information Technology. Thanks to their dedication to us, we have a strong foundation in computer science and acquire knowledge of the current state of the technology market. Owing to them, we are capable of learning and applying new technologies more effectively.
